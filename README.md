# HumanResources
The "Human Resources Management System" project aims to streamline the recruitment and candidate selection process for various roles within the company. The code provided below is a part of this system, which evaluates a candidate based on their assessment score and location.

First, the project collects data regarding the candidate's assessment score (variable "assessment_score") and their location (variables "location," "location2," "location3"). Then, based on this data, the project makes decisions regarding the candidate's qualifications for a specific position.

In the logical conditions, it checks whether the candidate meets the relevant criteria. If the candidate's location is "US" or "Canada" and their assessment score is at least 75, they are hired. If the location is "US" but not "Canada," and the assessment score is at least 75, the candidate receives a message stating that the role requires a location in the "US" or "Canada" and is asked if they are interested in another position. If the location is "Poland" and the assessment score is at least 75, the candidate is informed that they meet the requirements. Otherwise, if the candidate does not meet any of these conditions, they receive a message that their application will not be pursued.

This project helps efficiently manage the recruitment process by enabling automated candidate assessment and communication based on their assessment scores and locations.
